<main><h1> wssg, the Worst Static Site Generator</h1>
<h2> The Journey</h2>
<p>
The first version of this website was handcrafted HTML, each character lovingly typed.
This was incredibly time consuming, so I switched to using pandoc to generate the HTML files.
While allowing me to write in markdown, it was still pretty cumbersome.
Since the navbar content resided in a distinct <code>header.html</code> file, I needed to update that file, then run pandoc on each markdown file again.
I suppose I could have created a bash script to build the website this way, but bash is a scary language.
Lastly, I explored using Hugo or Jekyll as a substitute.
No theme matched what I was looking for exactly.
I figured, instead of learning how to build my own Hugo theme or mod someone elses, why don't I just write my own static website generator and get some Python practice while I'm at it?
</p>
<p>
This is why you don't do it, past Joshua.

<h2> wssg</h2>
<p>
<a href="https://github.com/joshuaoreilly/wssg">wssg</a>, pronounced about how you expect it, is my ongoing effort to write a static site generator.
The first version, which took a few days of tinkering here and there, uses RegEx to split lines of markdown text into clumps of special characters (such as headers using #, lists using -, etc.), then iterates through the list of strings with some half-baked state machine.
It really is a "write code and ask yourself if it's a good idea later" attempt.
</p>
<p>
It <i>does</i> work, kind of.
Bold text, italics, headers, hyperlinks, images, lists; they're supported.
But hyperlinks with dashes will break because I hard-coded the number of "clumps" from beginning to end of a link.
There's no nesting markdown syntax.
A lot of basic syntax still isn't supported; blockquotes, LaTeX, etc.
I figure a full rewrite of the markdown-to-html function using a proper state machine and character-by-character parsing is the most important thing to do, so that other changes don't end up needing to be re-written immediately.
